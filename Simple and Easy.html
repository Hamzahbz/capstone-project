    <p class="info3">Dates seem to have had a real jump in popularity in recent years…the dried fruit that is! It seems like most breakfast<br>
    and health food bars now use a date-base, which is understandable, given they hold lots of health benefits.<br>
    However, healthy is not a word you’d use to describe this Krispy Date Slice. Delicious though? Most definitely!</p>
